ACM Hub Cluster Certificate Analysis

━━━ Step 1: Cluster Information

Kubeconfig:    kubeconfig.c5
API Endpoint:  https://api.server-foundation-sno-lite-sqfc2.dev04.red-chesterfield.com:6443
OCP Version:   4.19.3
Current User:  system:admin

━━━ Step 2: Cluster Kube APIServer Certificates

Certificate Type: Custom Certificate (Private CA)
Subject:          CN=api.server-foundation-sno-lite-sqfc2.dev04.red-chesterfield.com
Issuer:           CN=signer1.example.com
Valid Until:      Mar 11 03:38:45 2026 GMT
Root CA Included: No

Certificate Chain:
  [1] Subject: CN=api.server-foundation-sno-lite-sqfc2.dev04.red-chesterfield.com
      Issuer:  CN=signer1.example.com

  [2] Subject: CN=signer1.example.com
      Issuer:  CN=example.com

  [3] Subject: CN=example.com (Not Included)
      Issuer:  CN=example.com

━━━ Step 3: ACM Status and Configuration

✓ ACM Status: NOT INSTALLED

━━━ Step 4: ACM Certificate Management Analysis

Recommended ServerVerificationStrategy:

  Recommended: UseAutoDetectedCABundle (after adding root CA)
  • ⚠️  ACM may work with current certificates but has rotation risks
  • Certificate rotation with different intermediate CA will cause managed clusters to enter unknown state

━━━ Step 5: Analysis Summary

OCP API Endpoint: https://api.server-foundation-sno-lite-sqfc2.dev04.red-chesterfield.com:6443
OCP Version: 4.19.3
Certificate Type: Custom-SelfSigned
Root CA Included: No
ACM: Not installed

ℹ ACM may work initially but has certificate rotation risk

Root CA is NOT included in certificate chain

Recommended actions:
  1. Add the root CA certificate to the certificate chain before installing ACM
  2. Re-run this analysis to confirm the complete chain is included

Risk if not addressed:
  • Certificate rotation with different intermediate CA will cause managed clusters to enter unknown state
  • Without root CA in chain, managed clusters cannot verify certificates signed by different intermediates
