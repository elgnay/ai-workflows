ACM Hub Cluster Certificate Analysis

━━━ Step 1: Cluster Information

Kubeconfig:    kubeconfig.c6
API Endpoint:  https://api.server-foundation-sno-lite-46gr7.dev04.red-chesterfield.com:6443
OCP Version:   4.19.3
Current User:  system:admin

━━━ Step 2: Cluster Kube APIServer Certificates

Certificate Type: Custom Certificate (Well-Known CA)
Subject:          CN=api.server-foundation-sno-lite-46gr7.dev04.red-chesterfield.com
Issuer:           C=US, O=Let's Encrypt, CN=R12
Valid Until:      Mar  1 02:34:38 2026 GMT
Root CA Included: Yes

Certificate Chain:
  [1] Subject: CN=api.server-foundation-sno-lite-46gr7.dev04.red-chesterfield.com
      Issuer:  C=US, O=Let's Encrypt, CN=R12

  [2] Subject: C=US, O=Let's Encrypt, CN=R12
      Issuer:  C=US, O=Internet Security Research Group, CN=ISRG Root X1

  [3] Subject: C=US, O=Internet Security Research Group, CN=ISRG Root X1
      Issuer:  C=US, O=Internet Security Research Group, CN=ISRG Root X1

━━━ Step 3: ACM Status and Configuration

✓ ACM Status: NOT INSTALLED

━━━ Step 4: ACM Certificate Management Analysis

Recommended ServerVerificationStrategy:

  Recommended: UseAutoDetectedCABundle or UseSystemTruststore
  • Option 1: UseAutoDetectedCABundle (full CA chain is included)
  • Option 2: UseSystemTruststore (well-known CA is trusted by system)

━━━ Step 5: Analysis Summary

OCP API Endpoint: https://api.server-foundation-sno-lite-46gr7.dev04.red-chesterfield.com:6443
OCP Version: 4.19.3
Certificate Type: Custom-WellKnown
Root CA Included: Yes
ACM: Not installed

✓ Safe to install ACM

Root CA is included in certificate chain

Next steps:
  1. Proceed with ACM installation
  2. (Optional) Configure UseSystemTruststore as the KubeAPIServer verification strategy in the global KlusterletConfig to simplify certificate management

Note:
  • Well-known CAs (e.g., Let's Encrypt) are already trusted by system trust stores
  • No required configuration
