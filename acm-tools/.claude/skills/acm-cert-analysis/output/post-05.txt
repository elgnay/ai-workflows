ACM Hub Cluster Certificate Analysis

━━━ Step 1: Cluster Information

Kubeconfig:    kubeconfig.c3
API Endpoint:  https://api.server-foundation-sno-lite-p24nr.dev04.red-chesterfield.com:6443
OCP Version:   4.19.3
Current User:  system:admin

━━━ Step 2: Cluster Kube APIServer Certificates

Certificate Type: Custom Certificate (Well-Known CA)
Subject:          CN=api.server-foundation-sno-lite-p24nr.dev04.red-chesterfield.com
Issuer:           C=US, O=Let's Encrypt, CN=R13
Valid Until:      Feb 16 00:04:26 2026 GMT
Root CA Included: No

Certificate Chain:
  [1] Subject: CN=api.server-foundation-sno-lite-p24nr.dev04.red-chesterfield.com
      Issuer:  C=US, O=Let's Encrypt, CN=R13

  [2] Subject: C=US, O=Let's Encrypt, CN=R13
      Issuer:  C=US, O=Internet Security Research Group, CN=ISRG Root X1

  [3] Subject: C=US, O=Internet Security Research Group, CN=ISRG Root X1 (Not Included)
      Issuer:  C=US, O=Internet Security Research Group, CN=ISRG Root X1

━━━ Step 3: ACM Status and Configuration

✓ ACM Status: INSTALLED
  Version:   2.15.0
  Namespace: open-cluster-management
  Name:      multiclusterhub
  Status:    Running
  ServerVerificationStrategy: UseSystemTruststore

━━━ Step 4: ACM Certificate Management Analysis

Recommended ServerVerificationStrategy:

  Recommended: UseSystemTruststore
  • UseSystemTruststore is recommended when root CA is not in the chain
  • Alternative: Add root CA to chain, then use UseAutoDetectedCABundle

  Current: UseSystemTruststore
  Status: ✓ Matches recommendation

━━━ Step 5: Analysis Summary

OCP API Endpoint: https://api.server-foundation-sno-lite-p24nr.dev04.red-chesterfield.com:6443
OCP Version: 4.19.3
Certificate Type: Custom-WellKnown
Root CA Included: No
ACM: Installed (Version 2.15.0)
ServerVerificationStrategy: UseSystemTruststore

✓ Configuration: Compatible

Current configuration is working correctly
  • No additional configuration required

Important considerations:
  • Certificate rotation is safe as long as signed by the same well-known CA
  • ⚠️  Do NOT change the root CA - this may cause managed clusters to enter unknown state
  • If you need to change the root CA, run skill acm-cert-change-assessment for impact and mitigation guidance
