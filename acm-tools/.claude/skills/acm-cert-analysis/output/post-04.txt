ACM Hub Cluster Certificate Analysis

━━━ Step 1: Cluster Information

Kubeconfig:    kubeconfig.c3
API Endpoint:  https://api.server-foundation-sno-lite-p24nr.dev04.red-chesterfield.com:6443
OCP Version:   4.19.3
Current User:  system:admin

━━━ Step 2: Cluster Kube APIServer Certificates

Certificate Type: Custom Certificate (Well-Known CA)
Subject:          CN=api.server-foundation-sno-lite-p24nr.dev04.red-chesterfield.com
Issuer:           C=US, O=Let's Encrypt, CN=R13
Valid Until:      Feb 16 00:04:26 2026 GMT
Root CA Included: No

Certificate Chain:
  [1] Subject: CN=api.server-foundation-sno-lite-p24nr.dev04.red-chesterfield.com
      Issuer:  C=US, O=Let's Encrypt, CN=R13

  [2] Subject: C=US, O=Let's Encrypt, CN=R13
      Issuer:  C=US, O=Internet Security Research Group, CN=ISRG Root X1

  [3] Subject: C=US, O=Internet Security Research Group, CN=ISRG Root X1 (Not Included)
      Issuer:  C=US, O=Internet Security Research Group, CN=ISRG Root X1

━━━ Step 3: ACM Status and Configuration

✓ ACM Status: INSTALLED
  Version:   2.15.0
  Namespace: open-cluster-management
  Name:      multiclusterhub
  Status:    Running
  ServerVerificationStrategy: UseAutoDetectedCABundle

━━━ Step 4: ACM Certificate Management Analysis

Recommended ServerVerificationStrategy:

  Recommended: UseSystemTruststore
  • UseSystemTruststore is recommended when root CA is not in the chain
  • Alternative: Add root CA to chain, then use UseAutoDetectedCABundle

  Current: UseAutoDetectedCABundle
  Status: ⚠️  Does not match recommendation

━━━ Step 5: Analysis Summary

OCP API Endpoint: https://api.server-foundation-sno-lite-p24nr.dev04.red-chesterfield.com:6443
OCP Version: 4.19.3
Certificate Type: Custom-WellKnown
Root CA Included: No
ACM: Installed (Version 2.15.0)
ServerVerificationStrategy: UseAutoDetectedCABundle

ℹ Configuration Notes

ACM may work with current certificates but has rotation limitations
  • Certificate rotation MUST use the same intermediate CA (C=US, O=Let's Encrypt, CN=R13)
  • Without root CA in chain, managed clusters cannot verify certificates signed by different intermediates

Recommended actions (choose one):
  • Option 1: Add root CA to the certificate chain (enables flexible rotation, continue using UseAutoDetectedCABundle)
    - After adding, re-run this skill to verify the configuration
  • Option 2: Configure UseSystemTruststore as the KubeAPIServer verification strategy (well-known CAs are already in system trust store)

Important considerations:
  • ⚠️  Changing intermediate CA or root CA will cause managed clusters to enter unknown state
  • If you need to change intermediate CA or root CA, run skill acm-cert-change-assessment for impact and mitigation guidance
